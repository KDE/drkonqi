This is a unit test for the BacktraceInfo class, which is used in drkonqi
to rate the usefulness of a backtrace.

This test dynamically loads test data from the "backtraceinfotest_data" directory.
To add new data, simply create a file starting with the "test_" prefix and paste
a backtrace in it. Then, in the "usefulness_map" file, add a line with the following format:

    test_file: UsefulnessValue

where "test_file" is the exact filename of the file containing the backtrace and
UsefulnessValue is the usefulness value that you expect the backtrace to get.
Whitespaces do not matter, they are ignored. Valid usefulness values can be seen
in backtraceinfotest.h, in the enum BacktraceInfoTest::Usefulness.

The UsefulnessValue has to be the enum's text representation of the
value and not an integer. For example, having the enum like this:

    enum Usefulness { ReallyUseful = 0, MayBeUseful=1, ProbablyUseless=2, Useless = 3 };

"ReallyUseful" is a valid value, but "0" isn't.


All files in the "backtraceinfotest_data" directory that do not start with the
"test_" prefix are ignored (except the "usefulness_map" file, which has a special
purpose, as described above)
