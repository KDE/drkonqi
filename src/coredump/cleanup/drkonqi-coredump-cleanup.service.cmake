# This is a bit of a stop-gap. Ideally we should have a different service run on login to
# pick up lingering crashes that are relevant (e.g. crash on last logout) and only what is
# left over should then get cleaned up (if the file is old enough).
# Since we currently lack the UI infrastructure for that we had better clean up on login
# unconditionally.
